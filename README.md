# ip-address-scanner

Calculate the number of unique IP addresses.

**Description:**

This approach for the IP scanner was tested on 110 GB of file size and does not have limitations on file size; 
it depends on your hardware capabilities. You can configure the percentage of free system memory to use, 
with the default set at 80%. The IP scanner automatically detects the file's read speed, splits the file into chunks, 
and calculates an optimal thread pool size.
**Important:**

This is a demo version.

## **TODO List**

1. Add validation of the entry file.
2. Add test cases.
3. Add documentation.
